Technology is revolutionizing how we operate in the world. But the social sector is rapidly being left behind as many organizations struggle to understand and use technology to its fullest potential.

Understanding the technology gap in non-profits

Zero IT Budget & Resources: small NGOs in India operate on minimal budgets. They cannot afford to hire dedicated technology staff who can execute and maintain systems for them. Those who do not have internal tech capacity often depend on vendors who overcharge and don’t understand their mission.

Opportunities & our approach:

Problem
Small & remote NGOs have no budget, capacity to hire, and manage dedicated information technology (IT) staff.

Opportunity
The low complexity of the technology needs of smaller NGOs.

Our Approach
VwithU provides IT Administration Services, implementation and consulting for small and remote NGOs

NGOs can use technology to:
 
• Raise their profile
• Keep up-to-date of current developments in their field
• Maintain and organize information more easily
• Accurately control their finances
• Securely manage their users’ contact details
• Learn who is using their service and how they can widen their reach
• Enable service users to support one another through online communities
• Save costs and operate more productively allowing staff to work remotely and flexibly
